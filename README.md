To Detect the Outlier

Internally create the decision tree. How it works?
For each and every datapoint the leafnode is created . Whenever the path is isolated quickly that is outlier.
Outlier datapoint it will be isolated very very quickly.

For each and every datapoint we will calculate anamoly score

![Alt text](https://github.com/srirampamerla/Unsupervised_Anomaly-Detection/blob/main/isolated.png?raw=true)

C(m) = Average depth of h(x) x=Data Point.( Depth of each and every datapoint tree) and find the Avg.
